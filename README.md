I am writing to apologize for any disappointment caused regarding the functionality of the email template editor I am working on using GrapeJS. While I have successfully implemented features to send data to the backend, download templates, load them, and allow editing, I am currently facing challenges with modifying the CSS for specific GrapeJS components, particularly the image editing section.

I understand the importance of ensuring full customization and flexibility in the email template editor, and I am actively exploring solutions to address this limitation. Please rest assured that I am committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible and will update you as soon as I have a working solution.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I truly appreciate your support and guidance.
